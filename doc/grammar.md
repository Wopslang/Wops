## Introduction

It is the official Wopslang language reference for v0.1 alpha.
Because this version is a test version, so lots of stuff in here can be changed.
Of course, lots of new grammar can be added to Wopslang.
So, make sure to check this page when you updated Wopslang to the newest version.

> Our language is based on an idea: simple, but powerful.
> And because our grammar was also designed with this idea, we developed only the most important expressions.
> However, we know that our standard of *importance* can be different from your standard.
> So, please tell us your idea of what to put into Wopslang.
> We would love to hear your voice.

## Notation

The syntax is specified using Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF).

## Source Code Representation

Source code is Unicode text encoded in [UTF-8]. Also, file extention of Wopslang code should be `.wops`

### Characters

```ebnf
newline    = /* U+000A */ .
uni_char   = /* an arbitrary Unicode code point except newline */ .
uni_letter = /* a Unicode code point classified as Letter */ .
uni_digit  = /* a Unicode code point classified as Number, decimal digit /* .
```

### Letter and digits

```ebnf
type      = "int" | "double" | "bool" | "string" .
letter    = uni_letter | "_" .
digit     = "0" ... "9" .
```

## Lexical Elements

### Comments

Comments can be represented with a form:  

- comments start with `//` and stop at the end of the line.

For example, this form will be allowed:

```go
// Good :D
out(":D")
```

And these forms won't be allowed:

```go
/*
Bad :(
*/
out(":(")
```

### Tokens

Token is the word which can be used in Wopslang. There are four types: *Identifiers, Keywords, Operators, Punctuation, and Literals*. White space, formed from spaces (U+0020), horizontal tabs (U+0009), carriage returns (U+000D), and newlines (U+000A), is ignored except as it separates tokens that would otherwise combine into a single token.

### Identifiers

Identifiers name program entities such as variables and types. An identifier is a sequence of one or more letters and digits. The first character in an identifier must be a letter.

```ebnf
identifiers = letter { letter | uni_digit } .
```

Example:

```go
abc
_WopsV01
ì˜µìŠ¤ëž­
Î±Î²
```

Some identifiers cannot be used. See [Keywords] for more detail.

### Keywords

The following keywords are reserved and may not be used as identifiers.

```text
break        const        continue
elif         else         for
if           range        
```

### Operators and Punctuation

The following character sequences represent operators (including assignment operators) and punctuation.

```text
+    &&    ==    !=    (    )
-    ||    <     <=    [    ]
*    >     >=    /     :    =
~    ;     %     ,     !
```

### Integer Literal

An integer literal is a sequence of digits representing an integer constant.

> In version v0.x, only decimal is allowed to use.

```ebnf
integer_lit    = "0" | ("1" â€¦ "9") [ decimal_digits ] .
decimal_digits = { digit } .
```

Example:

```go
42
197
0
32589
1

01 // (x)
34-5 // (x)
a56bc // (x)
```

### Boolean Literal

boolean literal is a bit representing boolean constant: *true `1`, and false `0`*.
If you assign other integer on a boolean literal, it will be stored as `1`.
Also, the operation between a boolean and an integer is regarded as one between integers but will end up as `1` unless the result is `0`.
Any operation between a boolean and a floating-point or assigning a floating-point to a boolean is prohibited (same with string).

```ebnf
bool_lit = "0" | "1".
```

### Floating-point Literal

A floating-point literal is a decimal representation of a floating-point constant. A decimal floating-point literal consists of an integer part (decimal digits), a decimal point, a fractional part (decimal digits).

```ebnf
float_lit = integer_lit | integer_lit "." decimal_digits
```

Example:

```go
0.7
3.141592653589793238
0.0
0.08

.3 // (x)
11. // (x)
```

### Rune Literal

A rune literal represents a rune constant, an integer value identifying a Unicode code point. A rune literal is expressed as one or more characters such as `\n`, `\"`.

After a backslash, certain single-character escapes represent special values:

|Literal|Unicode|Description|
|---|---|--|
|`\a`|U+0007|alert or bell|
|`\b`|U+0008|backspace|
|`\f`|U+000C|form feed|
|`\n`|U+000A|line feed or newline|
|`\r`|U+0007|carriage return|
|`\t`|U+0007|horizontal tab|
|`\v`|U+0007|vertical tab|
|`\\`|U+0007|backslash|
|`\'`|U+0007|single quote|
|`\"`|U+0007|double quote|

```ebnf
rune_lit      = "'" uni_value "'" .
uni_value     = uni_char | escaped_char .
escaped_char  = `\` ( "a" | "b" | "f" | "n" | "r" | "t" | "v" | `\` | "'" | `"` ) .
```

### String Literal

A string literal represents a string constant obtained from concatenating a sequence of characters.

```ebnf
string_lit = `"` { unicode_value } `"` .
```

Example:

```go
"abc"
"Hello, World!\n"
"Wopslang is ì˜µìŠ¤ëž­"
"ðŸ¤–"
"\"" // Same with '"'
```

## Types

A data type or simply type is an attribute which notate a particular kind of data item.  
There are four kind of type: *Integer, Floating-Point, String, and Boolean*. And it can be notated with these [predeclared identifiers][Predeclared Identifiers]:

|Identifier|Matching Type|Description|
|---|---|--|
|`int`|Integer|signed 32-bit integers (-2147483648 ~ 2147483647)|
|`double`|Floating-Point|IEEE-754 64-bit floating-point numbers|
|`string`|String|[same with string literal][String Literal]|
|`bool`|Boolean|[same with boolean literal][Boolean Literal]|

```ebnf
Type = "int" | "double" | "string" | "bool" .
```

## Variables

A variable is a storage for holding a value. The set of available values is determined by the variable's [type][Types].
There are two types of variable which can be used in Wopslang v0.1: *constant variable, modifiable variable*. You can declare constant variable as adding const keyword in variable declare expression. Also, you should add initial value to declare constant variable and you won't be able to reassign its value. Interpreter can emit the error if value's representing type doesn't match with variable's type.

```go
int woo = toint(in())
int ooo = -1

string poo = "result: " + tostring(woo + ooo)
string soo = poo
```

## Expressions

### Blocks

A block is an empty sequence of declarations and statements within `:` and `;`.

```ebnf
Block = ":" [ Statements ] ";" .
IfBlock = "?" [ Statements ] ";" .
ForBlock = "$" [ Statements ] ";" .
Statements = { Statement } .
```

if and for expression is considered to be in its own block.

### Declarations

A declaration bind *identifiers* and *value* to a constant or [variable][Variables].
Every identifier in a program must be declared, and no identifier may be declared twice in the same block. See [Variables] to get more information.

```ebnf
Declaration = ConstVarDel | VarDel .
ConstVarDel = "const" Type identifiers "=" Expression .
VarDel = Type identifiers [ "=" Expression ] .
```

To find syntax defination of `Expression`, see [Operators] for more.

### Operands

Operands represent the elementary values in an expression. It can be a *literal*, a *function*, or a *variable*.

```ebnf
Operand = Literal | OpndName | "(" Expression ")" .
Literal = integer_lit | float_lit | rune_lit | string_lit .
OpndName = identifier .
```

Also, there are some unit expression groups:

```ebnf
UnitExpr = Operand |
           UnitExpr Arguments .

Arguments = "(" ( [ Expression ] | { Expression "," } Expression ) ")" .
```

For example:

```go
foo
boo
(3 + 0.25)
out("Hello, World!\n", "Nice to meet you :D")
```

### Calls

Here is the basic formation of function:

```ebnf
f(a1, a2, a3, ...)
```

You can call a function by passing some arguments. If the function which you want to use has fixed arguments(such as `out` function; it doesn't have any arguments(0 argument)), you must follow that formation.

```go
out("Hello, Wopslang!")
in()
toint("352")
toint("abc") // it emits error
```

### Operators

Operators bind operands into expressions.

```ebnf
Expression = UnaryExpr | Expression BinaryExpr Expression .
UnaryExpr  = UnitExpr | unary_op UnaryExpr .

binary_op  = "||" | "&&" | rel_op | add_op | mul_op .
rel_op     = "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" .
add_op     = "+" | "-"  .
mul_op     = "*" | "/" | "%" .
unary_op   = "!" | "+" | "-" .
```

Each operator has a different priority for parsing. For instance, unary operators have the highest priority.

|Priority|Operators|
|--------|---------|
|5|`*`, `/`, `%`|
|4|`+`, `-`|
|3|`==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`|
|2|`&&`|
|1|`\|\|`|

The leftmost operator in the same priority has a higher priority.
For instance, `a+b-c` is the same with `(a+b)-c`.

### Arithmetic Operators

|Operator|Matching Literals|
|--------|-----------------|
|`+`|integer, float, string|
|`-`|integer, float|
|`*`|integer, float|
|`/`|integer, float|
|`%`|integer|

If you divide by zero(`A/0` or `A%0`, A:expression), interpreter will emit the error. Also, ***If you divide with integers, the result will be integer, too.***

### Conversion

You can change the [type][Types] of expression by using conversion function: `toint()` and `tostring()`. See [Builtin Functions] for more information.

## Statements

Statements control execution.

```ebnf
Statement =
         Declaration | SimpleStmt |
         BreakStmt | ContinueStmt |
         IfStmt | ForStmt .

SimpleStmt = Blank | Expression | Assignment .
```

### Blank Statement

The blank statement does nothing.

```ebnf
Blank = .
```

### Assignment

The assignment statement assigns a value to the specified variable.

```ebnf
Assignment = identifiers "=" Expression .
```

For `=` assignment, Left-side operand should be lvalue.
Also, left-side and right-side operand should share matching type(same type, double-int, ...).
For `<-` assignment, right-side should be a container matching with left-side operand's type.

```go
a = "Hello, " + in()
b = 30 * (50 / 27)  // b = 30
c = 0.5 - 1.3
```

### If Statement

*If* statements specify the conditional execution of more than two branches according to the value of a boolean expression. If value is true, `if` branches will be executed, otherwise, highest `elif` branches will be executed. If every `if` and `elif` branches' expression is false, `else` branch will be executed.  

For example:

```go
if a == 1 ?
    // A
; a > 1 ?
    // B
; a < 2 ?
    // C
; ?
    // D
;
```

If a is 1, `A`'ll be executed. If a is larger than 1, `B`'ll be executed. For `C`, if a is smaller than 2 and larger than 1, `C` won't be executed. `C` will be executed if a is smaller than 1. `D` won't be executed ever.

```ebnf
IfStmt = "if" Expression IfBlock
      { ";" Expression IfBlock }
      [ ";" IfBlock ]
```

### For Statement

*For* statement represents repeating execution of a block.
There are two types of for statement: *using a single condition*, and *using an array*.

```ebnf
ForStmt = "for" ( Expression | ForClause ) ForBlock .
```

#### For statement with single condition

A *for* statement with single condition represents repeating execution of a block as long as a boolean condition evaluates to true. The condition is evaluated before each iteration.

```go
for a % 2 $
    out(tostring(a) + "\n")
;
```

#### For statement with for clause

A *for* statement with for clause use special operator `~` to denote a sequence.
Special operator (only available in for clause) `~` denotes the arithmetic integer sequence.
Basicaly, `a~b` denotes a sequence from `a` to `b-1` with interval `1`.
You can also decide specific interval c using `a~b~c`.
Operator `~` has the lowest priority in the whole operators.
Finally, *for* statement repeat execution of a block with that sequence.

```ebnf
ForClause = identifiers "in" Expression "~" Expression [ "~" Expression ].
```

```go
for i in 0~6~2 $
    out(tostring(i) + "\n")
;
```

Output:

```text
0
2
4
```

### Break and Continue Statement

A *break* or *continue* statement terminates or passes execution of innermost `for` statement.

```ebnf
BreakStmt = "break" .
ContinueStmt = "continue" .
```
